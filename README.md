LAZARUS app project. A cross-platform Flutter based mobile application that uses alternative solutions (some of which implement AI) on top of Bluetooth low energy contact tracing, to keep record of human-to-human contacts, even when Bluetooth is not activated. The app can also make physical and mental health assessments, with user's consent, to predict possible causes of illness, by using cloud(Azure)-based healthcare chatbot, text-analytics and NLP service.
